Welcome everyone to our session on how to start your own code club! This session was organised for you by me (Cecilia), Saoirse, Natalie, and Corné. We will be your facilitators today. All of us are or have been Code Club leaders, and we can't wait to hear your experiences, questions and concerns about running (or even participating!) in a Code Club.

A bit of housekeeping first. As our wonderful TA already mentioned, we all abide to SORTEE Code of Conduct (share link). We want to create an environment that is safe for everyone to share, and have their opinions and experiences feel valued. For this reason, please remember to raise your hand if you'd like to speak or ask qustions live. If you can't unmute, or don't feel comfortable to do so, you can use the Zoom chat for questions, or type directly in the Google Doc which is in this qr code and is being shared in the chat. 
You can also react with emojis for quick votes! You can share as much or as little you want, and there's no "stupid questions"!
