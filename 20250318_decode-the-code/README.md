# üêß Decode the Code: Cleaning Messy R Code Together

Welcome to **"Decode the Code"**, a hands-on session where we work together to clean and improve messy R code! This repository contains a deliberately messy R script that participants will clean and optimize in groups.

## About this session
This session is part of the [**SORTEE Code Club**](https://www.sortee.org/code_club/), an online meeting where people come together to learn, share, and collaborate on coding-related topics in an informal and supportive environment.  

SORTEE Code Club is **not about being an expert coder**‚Äîit‚Äôs about *open science*, *peer learning*, and making coding more *accessible* and *reproducible* for everyone.
