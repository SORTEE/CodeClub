# From Notebook to Paper

This repository contains a fully reproducible demo of how to structure a computational notebook as a scientific manuscript using **Quarto** and **RStudio**.

The project walks through:
- Cleaning and analyzing the [`palmerpenguins`](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) dataset
- Fitting a simple linear model
- Generating plots
- Writing and rendering the manuscript (`index.qmd`) into PDF, HTML, or Word format
- Using Quarto to combine code, results, and text in one place
