  abstract = {In 2024, all biology is computational biology. Computer-aided analysis continues to spread into new fields, becoming more accessible to researchers trained in the wet lab who are eager to take advantage of growing datasets, falling costs, and novel assays that present new opportunities for discovery. It is currently much easier to find guidance for implementing these techniques than for reporting their use, leaving biologists to guess which details and files are relevant. In this essay, we review existing literature on the topic, summarize common tips, and link to additional resources for training. Following this overview, we then provide a set of recommendations for sharing code, with an eye toward guiding those who are comparatively new to applying open science principles to their computational work. Taken together, we provide a guide for biologists who seek to follow code sharing best practices but are unsure where to start.},

  abstract = {Norms of behavior in scientific research represent ideals to which most scientists subscribe. Our analysis of the extent of dissonance between these widely espoused ideals and scientists' perceptions of their own and others' behavior is based on survey responses from 3,247 mid- and early-career scientists who had research funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health. We found substantial normative dissonance, particularly between espoused ideals and respondents' perceptions of other scientists' typical behavior. Also, respondents on average saw other scientists' behavior as more counternormative than normative. Scientists' views of their fields as cooperative or competitive were associated with their normative perspectives, with competitive fields showing more counternormative behavior. The high levels of normative dissonance documented here represent a persistent source of stress in science.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility is widely acknowledged as a fundamental principle in scientific research. Currently, the scientific community grapples with numerous challenges associated with reproducibility, often referred to as the ''reproducibility crisis.'' This crisis permeated numerous scientific disciplines. In this study, we examined the factors in scientific practices that might contribute to this lack of reproducibility. Significant focus is placed on the prevalent integration of computation in research, which can sometimes function as a black box in published papers. Our study primarily focuses on highperformance computing (HPC), which presents unique reproducibility challenges. This paper provides a comprehensive review of these concerns and potential solutions. Furthermore, we discuss the critical role of reproducible research in advancing science and identifying persisting issues within the field of HPC.},

  abstract = {Open, reproducible, and replicable research practices are a fundamental part of science. Training is often organized on a grassroots level, offered by early career researchers, for early career researchers. Buffet style courses that cover many topics can inspire participants to try new things; however, they can also be overwhelming. Participants who want to implement new practices may not know where to start once they return to their research team. We describe ten simple rules to guide participants of relevant training courses in implementing robust research practices in their own projects, once they return to their research group. This includes (1) prioritizing and planning which practices to implement, which involves obtaining support and convincing others involved in the research project of the added value of implementing new practices; (2) managing problems that arise during implementation; and (3) making reproducible research and open science practices an integral part of a future research career. We also outline strategies that course organizers can use to prepare participants for implementation and support them during this process.},
