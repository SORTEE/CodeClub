# SORTEE Code Club

Welcome to the SORTEE Code Club GitHub repository! üéâ

SORTEE Code Club is an online community where researchers and coders come together to learn, share, and collaborate on coding-related topics in an informal and supportive environment. Our focus is on **open science**, **peer learning**, and making coding more **accessible** and **reproducible** for everyone.  
üîó [Visit the Code Club website](https://www.sortee.org/code_club/)

## Meeting schedule

We meet online **every third Tuesday of the month**. We host two types of sessions:

- **Training Sessions**: Learn new coding skills, packages, models, and tools that support open science.
- **Hacky Hours**: Casual peer-to-peer sessions for code review, troubleshooting, and sharing tips and tricks.
