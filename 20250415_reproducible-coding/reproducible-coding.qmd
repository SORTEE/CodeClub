## Today's Agenda

<br> We'll cover:

-   What reproducibility actually means
-   Why reproducibility matters
-   Using R Projects
-   Managing package dependencies with `renv`
-   Handling different R versions
-   Some limitations and tips

*Disclaimer*: today's Code Club will focus on Reproducibility in **R**

## Introduction to Reproducibility in R

A reproducible coding environment is a computational setup with clearly documented code, data, software versions, and methods allowing exact replication of results.

![Original comic from xkcd](img/package-hell.png)

## The Why

Reproducible coding environments:

-   Ensure reliability and credibility of research findings
-   Facilitate collaborative research and transparent scientific communication
-   Enable efficient troubleshooting and debugging
-   Save time by reducing redundant efforts to recreate computational setups
-   Promote best practices in scientific computing and data analysis

::: notes
So, why are we talking about reproducible coding environments? Why is a reproducible coding environment important?
:::

## The How

There is no single solution or perfect approach to reproducibility <br><br> Instead, there are a collection of **various best strategies** that you can use!

![](https://solutions.posit.co/envs-pkgs/environments/spectrum-1.png){.centered}

## Example

For example, consider different ways of referencing file paths in your R scripts:

``` {.r code-line-numbers="1-3|5-7|9-11|13-15"}
# Bad: absolute path
setwd("C:/Users/MyName/Documents/Project/Data")
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# OK: relative path extensively documented in README (but fragile!)
setwd("~/Downloads/Data")
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Better: using here package, but without RProject the structure is unclear
library(here)
data <- read.csv(here("Data", "data.csv"))

# Best: explicit use of an R project (.Rproj file) ensures 'here()' always resolves correctly
library(here)
data <- read.csv(here("Data", "data.csv"))
```

::: notes
It's important to begin implementing reproducible practices incrementally, building up complexity and robustness over time rather than aiming for perfection from the start.
:::

## The How: .RProject

R Projects is a way to organize all your analysis files into one easy-to-use place. <br><br>

R Projects make your life easier because:

-   Paths are simple(r)
-   Easy collaboration
-   Less confusion

## How to make an .RProject

## Example : .RProject

For example:

![](img/Rproj1.png){width="40%"}

![](img/Rproj2.png){.fragment width="50%"}

::: notes
R Projects is one of the simplest and most effective ways to quickly become more reproducible. When you create an R Project, you get a special `.Rproj` file that marks the project's root directory, meaning everything you do in that project stays nicely contained. - Paths are simple(r): You don't have to worry about absolute paths that break when you move your files. Every file path you use is relative to your project, so it's easy to share and move around without things breaking. - Easy collaboration: Because all your project's files are in one clear place, anyone who receives your project can easily set it up on their computer and run your code exactly as you intended. - Less confusion: No more wondering where files are stored or which files belong to your analysis. Everything related to your project stays together and is clearly structured.

## .RProject is not enough alone

::: fragment
Even though an R Project helps organize your analysis into one coherent location... <br><br>
:::

::: fragment
... You still need a **structured directory layout** to organize your file inside this project to get the most out of it
:::

## Organise your Files!

::: notes
Having an R project is a good start, but you still need to organise your files in a meaningful way, you can't just throw everything in the same cauldron.

## Understanding Packages📦 and Libraries📘

**Packages📦** reside within a **library📘**, a directory on your computer where R stores installed packages

Managing package versions matters for:

-   **Version control**
-   **Transparency**
-   **Open projects**

:::
::::::::

::: notes
Tracking and communicating package versions is essential for true reproducibility

-   It is important to KNOW that running the same code with different versions of the same package may show different results. Thus, knowing exactly which package version your analysis uses helps prevent inconsistencies. -Clearly specifying the exact versions of libraries and packages used in your project helps ensure that collaborators or reviewers can replicate your analysis
-   This is also true for anyone accessing your project to reliably reproduce your results, including yourself in the future!
:::

## The How: Managing Packages with `renv`

`renv` helps make your R projects reproducible by managing your package dependencies

-   It records which packages (and their versions) you're using in your project.
-   It helps you avoid package version conflicts across different projects.
-   It ensures that your project setup can be easily replicated later.

::: notes
renv stands for "R environment," and it's a package designed to keep your R project's packages consistent and reproducible. Think of it like taking a "snapshot" of exactly which R packages you're using in your project, including their exact versions.

Why does this matter? Because packages in R are constantly being updated, and sometimes updates change the way packages behave. Without controlling package versions, your code might run perfectly today but fail or give different results a few months down the line.
:::

## Using renv: you, starting the project

-   `renv::init()`: create an isolated library for your project
-   `renv::snapshot()`: save exact versions of packages you're using into a `renv.lock` file 
<br>

::: fragment
This lockfile acts like a recipe that describes the environment your project needs to run.
:::

:::{.notes}
When you're working on a new project and want to make it reproducible, here's what you do:
- `renv::init()` — this creates a private library just for your project. That means any packages you install won’t interfere with other projects.
- As you install packages and write code, use `renv::snapshot()` to save the current state of your project's library. This creates a file called `renv.lock`, which records exactly which packages you’re using, their versions, and where they came from.
:::

## Using renv: someone else, with your project

- `renv::restore()`

::: fragment
*Yes, that's it.*
:::


::: notes
Let’s say someone else wants to run your code. They don’t need to guess what packages or versions you used — they just run:

The command renv::restore() reads your `renv.lock` file and automatically installs all the required packages in the correct versions. It recreates the same package setup you used.

renv greatly simplifies reproducing the exact environment and package setup used in your project
:::

## Limitations

:::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
`renv` doesn't handle:

-   R itself (versions)
-   System dependencies (compilers, external libraries)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](https://github.com/shannonpileggi/renv-challenges/raw/main/img/renv_choice_1.jpg)
:::

::::

::: notes
However, no single tool handles everything. One of the limitations most R users forget abut renv is that renv does not handle R versions. So you could have a perfectly documented, saved project, but it might break because over time a new R version has been implemented. So you need complementary tools.
:::


## Managing R Versions

Sometimes it's not just about the packages — the version of R itself can matter too. 
<br><br>

That's where **Rig** comes in.


:::{.notes}
Small changes between versions of R can affect how packages behave or whether certain functions are even available.
:::

## What is Rig?

Rig is a lightweight tool that helps you manage multiple versions of R on the same machine.

- It works on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.
- You can easily install new R versions.
- You can switch between R versions with a simple command.

## Why Use Rig?

- Makes it easy to test code across R versions.
- Simplifies keeping old projects running on older setups.
- Plays well with tools like `renv`, completing the reproducibility setup.
<br><br>

::: fragment
🧩 renv manages your packages <br>
🛠️ Rig manages your R versions
:::

:::{.notes}
rig supports long-term reproducibility. If someone opens your project years later, they can install the same version of R and restore your setup.
:::

## Wrapping Up

Improving reproducibility:

- Organize projects clearly
- Manage dependencies carefully (`renv`)
- Use version management (Rig)
- Document everything!
