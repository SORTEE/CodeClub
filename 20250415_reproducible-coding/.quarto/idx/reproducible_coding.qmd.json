Think of it like taking a \"snapshot\" of exactly which R packages you're using in your project, including their exact versions.\n\nWhy does this matter? Because packages in R are constantly being updated, and sometimes updates change the way packages behave.

That means any packages you install won’t interfere with other projects.\n- As you install packages and write code, use `renv::snapshot()` to save the current state of your project's library. This creates a file called `renv.lock`, which records exactly which packages you’re using, their versions, and where they came from.\n:::\n\n## Using renv: someone else, with your project\n\n- `renv::restore()`\n\n::: fragment\n*Yes, that's it.*\n:::\n\n\n::: notes\nLet’s say someone else wants to run your code.
