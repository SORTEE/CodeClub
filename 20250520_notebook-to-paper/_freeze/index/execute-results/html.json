In this demonstration, we explore how Quarto can be used to turn an exploratory data analysis into a transparent and reproducible scientific manuscript. Using the Palmer Penguins dataset, we test how bill length varies with depth, species, and sex. We show how Quarto enables a seamless integration of data, code, and narrative that is both executable and publication-ready.\n\n# Introduction\n\nThe *palmerpenguins* @palmerpenguins2020 dataset has become a beloved alternative to the canonical iris dataset, offering richer ecological features and more realistic data imperfections. Bill length and depth are key morphological features in penguins, thought to relate to feeding ecology and sexual dimorphism. However, our true aim is not to contribute to penguin biology—but to demonstrate how to structure a computational notebook as a manuscript using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) @Geert2025Reproducible.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nknitr::include_graphics(\"figures/penguins.png\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Illustration of Adélie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins.

In this paper, we present a simple analysis of penguin morphology and show how Quarto can help you go from messy scripts to publication-ready documents.\n\n# Methods\n\nWe used the `palmerpenguins` R package to access morphological data on three penguin species observed at the Palmer Station, Antarctica. Our cleaned dataset includes 333 individuals with complete measurements for bill length, bill depth, and sex.\n\nData were cleaned in `scripts/clean-data.R` and analyzed in `scripts/analysis.R`, with all outputs saved to the `output/` folder. We modeled bill length as a function of bill depth, species, and sex using a linear model. The entire workflow is organized in a Quarto project with version-controlled scripts and data.\n\n# Results\n\nThe model suggests that bill length increases with bill depth. Additionally, both species and sex have notable effects on bill size, with males generally exhibiting longer bills.\n\nThe figure below shows the estimated coefficients from the model:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-model-coeffs .cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(readr) \nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nsource(\"scripts/clean-data.R\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nsource(\"scripts/analysis.R\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nRows: 333 Columns: 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): species, island, sex\ndbl (3): bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, year\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\ncoeffs <- read_csv(\"output/model_coeffs.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\nRows: 5 Columns: 5\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (1): term\ndbl (4): estimate, std.error, statistic, p.value\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nggplot(coeffs, aes(x = term, y = estimate)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = estimate - std.error * 1.96,\n                    ymax = estimate + std.error * 1.96),\n                width = 0.2) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Model Coefficients\",\n       x = \"Term\", y = \"Estimate\") +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Estimated coefficients from the model showing effects of bill depth, species, and sex on bill length.](index_files/figure-html/fig-model-coeffs-1.png){#fig-model-coeffs fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n# Discussion / Conclusions\n\nOur mini-analysis illustrates how biological patterns (such as sexual dimorphism and inter-species differences) can be explored reproducibly using Quarto. But more importantly, this mock manuscript showcases how Quarto empowers researchers to write, code, and publish all in one place.\n\nEvery result shown here is fully traceable to the raw data, and every step of the analysis is version-controlled. This makes Quarto an excellent tool not only for individual projects but also for collaborative, transparent research workflows.\n\nFuture work may involve building more complex models or using Quarto to produce companion websites and teaching resources alongside publications.\n\n# References\n",
